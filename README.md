Hello guys

I have designed a bank management system, which is helpful for monitoring the transactions,accounts and details of a particular customer.
here, I have used JAVA as the main language for my project with the help pre build packages Swing and awt which is popularly used for creating desktop based applications.

In this repository, I have uploaded all the java classes and the icons which are used for completion of project.

There are two more jar files which are used for implementing calendar and sql connector which is used for establishing connection with the mysql database.

I have used Apache Netbeans and MySQL workbench for creating the project.
